Pyber Ride Sharing

Anaylysis 

 - It is obvious that most activity occur in "Urban" areas,but there seems to be similar activity in Suburban areas. Rural areas only make up less than 7% of total fares. I believe further cost analysis should be performed tp determine ROI in these areas. There may be opportunities to create a driver hybrid program to off-set some company overhead, depending on results of further analysis.

- Secondly, rural riders pay 5-10% more in fares, but take fewer trips. Company can run a promotion to test "hybrid driver" program hypothesis. 

- Suburban rides make up more than 25% of all rides, but only make up 12% of total drivers. There may be oppurtunity to grow the driver count and possible gain more market share.
